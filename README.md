To compile the program, type <gcc observer.c> (without <>). This will generate an "a.out" file.
Now, to run it in STANDARD mode, simply type in <./a.out> (without <>). 
To run the program in SHORT report mode, type <./a.out -s> (without <>).
To run the program in LONG report mode, type <./a.out -l [interval] [duration]> (without <> or []), 
where interval and duration are integer values correspnding to the number of intervals and the size of those intervals.
